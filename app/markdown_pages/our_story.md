# Our Story

## Met at Grad School
We met at a venue so romantic you would think this was the
plot of a Disney movie: graduate school. During "communications training"
at the NC State Institute for Advanced Analytics we first became friends.

Friendship --> dating

Class of 2018 graduation

## Thailand Trip
After being together for a few short months we went to Thailand for 15 days! The trip was Victoria's first experience with international travel... quite a culture shock!

Before our trip we completed our scuba certificaiton.

Victoria was working from hope before it was cool
and we've been together in Boston for the past 4 years

## Scuba Trips & Fun Photos

One of our favorite vacation activities is Scuba diving. Over the years
we've had the opportunity to dive in some great places including: Grand Cayman,
Jamaica, Thailand and Key Largo.
